# Digits_Classification
Handwritten digits classification with a keras convnet. The notebook contains a <code>Start</code/> button to open a canvas on which you can draw a number from 0 to 9. The image is then processed and handed to the trained keras convnet. The prediction is shown as an browser alert popup.
