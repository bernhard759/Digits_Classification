# Digits_Classification

Handwritten digits classification with a keras convnet. The notebook contains a <code>Start</code> button to open a canvas on which you can draw a number from 0 to 9. After drawing, one has to exit the canvas window by clicking <code>e</code> on the keyboard. 

The image is then processed and handed to the trained keras convnet. The prediction is shown as an browser alert popup.
